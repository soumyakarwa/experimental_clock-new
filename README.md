I've always been fascinated with the relationship between light & time. And how sometimes, the stars we 
see in the night sky might have already died, because they might be so far away that their light has 
taken years to reach us. We see stars that are billions of light-years away as they were billions of years 
ago. I find it really profound that light (or waves itself) creates a difference between the time at 
which things happen and the time at which we are able to see them.

The left screen shows the stars in real time and the right screen shows us when it reaches Earth depending
on how far the star is from us.
